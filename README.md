Piece made for 'Emerging LatinX Identities' at Museo del Barrio (2019)

‘Tangled’ 2019
(wool, hand dyed alpaca yarn)
A computer generated textile pattern that maps a digital matrix of 0s and 1s to the movement of the yarn within the warp, thus creating a complex weft. Its sourced material is a non-linear narrative, that is converted into a apparently messy weaving. ‘Tangled’ reminds us that silence is easy, and talking is hard, by highlighting the pauses and suppressing the words. This piece takes inspiration from Cellular Automata, where simple rules yield rich and complex patterns, and is a sample of the artist’s ongoing practice of mapping speech into weaving and textiles.
